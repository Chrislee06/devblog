## Introduction

I believe cognitive reserve is a key factor for preventing Alzheimer's disease. I would want to find more about this topic. 

## What is brain reserve?
Brain reserve is a neuroanatomic resource that reflects structural properties of the brain that somehow afford a surplus capacity to maintain cognitive function despite substantial loss of their material substrate. Brain reserve is more about the morphological characteristics of the brain. These include the brain size, certain parts of the brain, and how the  different parts work effectively together. Unlike the cognitize reserve, it is difficult to affect brain reserve or develop brain reserve. 


## What is cognitive reserve?
You can think of cognitive reserve as your brain's ability to improvise and find alternate ways. It is a reserve of thinking abilities that were developed during their lives, and that this protects them against losses that can occur through ageing and disease. It is a brain's ability to cope with chnages in the brain, so when disruption is caused by ageing or disease, some people’s brains cope better than others. 

What factors affect cognitive reserve?
Research suggests that our level of intelligence, which traces back to childhood, and our set of lifetime experiences, help build cognitive reserve and may account for differences in cognitive reserve between us.

The lifetime experiences include education, having an engaging occupation and taking part in stimulating activities, the latter ideally combining leisure activities, learning and social interactions.
