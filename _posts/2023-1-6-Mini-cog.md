## Mini cog 

There are various screening test for dementia, however the most acccessible screening test is the Mini Cog. The Mini-Cog is a fast and simple screening test to help detect dementia in its early stages. It is a rapid screening test that indentifies possible cognitive impairment in older patients.

## Test structure

The Mini Cog consists of 3 seperate stages: Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3. In Stage 1, the app provides 3 words to the patient and ensures the patients to try memorizing the word. Then, ask the patient to repeat the 3 words stated. If the patient can't repeat the 3 words, move on to the next stage. 

The second stage is the most crucial part of Mini Cog, the clock drawing. Provide a paper with a circle on the middle, and ask the patient to draw a circle and mark each part of the clock including the numbers, the minute hand, and the hour hand. If the patient isn't able to complete this in 3 minutes, move on to the next step
