## What is Dearmonday?

## Personal thoughts on Dearmonday

### The concept of Workation

Workation? (created by combining the words work and vacation) is a recent travel trend that means working in a usual mode while traveling long-term.

My personal thoughts on Workation isn't optimistic. I believe that work and vaction are words that have polar opposite defintions. So, if these two are combined I am concerned about the effectiveness of this program. These two are completely different events, and the the attempt two multitask these events will lead to decreased productivity.

### Website

The website of Dearmonday is profound. The website is based on bright colors which portrays an optimistic view on the users. The Website is structured and well organized with clear headings and titles.

The biggest factor that appealed was the great use of images. Instead to long descriptive paragraphs about the program, the website includes numerous photos that the users can view.

Overall, the reviews were positive, and it seems like many people have benefited from Dearmonday's programs. The workation promotes a sense of community, and experiencing new places leads to new innovations and boosts creativity. These reviews have played a big part at resolving my doubts on Dearmonday. Just like myself, there are multiple individuals who were skeptical on the combination of work and vacation. However, users have said that workation is a special experience that enchances team chemistry and promotes a sense of community.
