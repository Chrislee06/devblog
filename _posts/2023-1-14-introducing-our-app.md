The Mini cog test consists of 3 crucial steps. In Stage 1, the app provides 3 words to the patient and ensures the patients to try memorizing the word. Then, ask the patient to repeat the 3 words stated. If the patient can't repeat the 3 words, move on to the next stage.

If the patient isn't able to complete this in 3 minutes, move on to the next step
